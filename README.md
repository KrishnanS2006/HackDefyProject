## Introduction
Have you ever wanted to connect with friends or family and watch youtube videos that isn't live streamed? Have you ever wanted a room with no distractions to study a Youtube Video with friends? Well Youtube Party is the place for you! With YouTube Party, anyone can create a room with a YouTube video, invite their friends, and chat about the video live!

## Inspiration
Our inspiration for this project was the current pandemic situation. Although some theaters are open, many of us are scared by the virus and try to stay at home as much as possible.

In the future, we hope to implement realtime pause, play, and bookmark functionality to the app. We also hope to implement the limitation of anyone joining the room, meaning that the host has the ability to accept or deny accsess to the room through username broadcasting
